# Predicting the Dynamics of Microcantilevers for Radiative Heat and Momentum Transfer on the Nanoscale

In the field of radiative heat transfer, the near-field regime occurs when the sizes of objects and/or the
distances between them are smaller than the peak wavelength of thermal radiation according to Wien’s law.
The deviation from traditional laws of thermal radiation in the near-field is well-documented; however, the
transition to the contact regime—from radiation to conduction—is poorly understood. This transition is
often studied using scanning probe microscopy, which includes various techniques that utilize microcantilevers
as probes, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM). A significant challenge in these studies is overcoming
“snap-in” — the abrupt jump to contact between two closely spaced surfaces due to surface forces.

In this project we aim to model the snap-in phenomenon and explore the feasibility of transiently probing
radiative heat and momentum transfer during this event.
